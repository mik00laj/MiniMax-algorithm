# MiniMax-algorithm
The game using MiniMax algorithm

The game involves two players taking turns selecting numbers from an n-element vector. Each player can choose either the first or the last number from the vector on their turn. The game continues until all numbers have been chosen. The objective for each player is to maximize the sum of the numbers they collect. The player who achieves the highest sum wins the game.

For example n = 4, consider the vector [2, 0, 3, 1]. The optimal gameplay for the starting player would be to select [2, 3], leaving the second player with [0, 1] or [1, 0].
